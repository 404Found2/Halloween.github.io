            <div class="subTime">Halloween Begins as Samhain</div>
            <div class="des">Ancient Celts, who lived 2,000 years ago in the area that is now Ireland, the United
                Kingdom and northern France, marked Samhain at the midpoint between the fall equinox and the winter
                solstice. During this time of year, hearth fires in family homes were left to burn out while the harvest
                was gathered. After the harvest work was complete, celebrants joined with Druid priests to light massive
                bonfires and pray. <br><br> Celts believed that the barrier between the physical and spirit worlds was
                breachable during Samhain. It was expected that ancestors might cross over during this time as well, and
                Celts would dress as animals and monsters so that fairies were not tempted to kidnap them.</div>

        <div class="text">
            <div class="time">10th Century</div>
            <div class="subTime">Samhain Is Christianized</div>
            <div class="des">In the 7th century, the Catholic Church established November 1 as All Saints' Day, a day
                commemorating all the saints of the church. By the 9th century, the influence of Christianity had spread
                into Celtic lands, where it gradually blended with and supplanted older Celtic rites. In 1000 A.D., the
                church made November 2 All Souls’ Day, a day to honor the dead. It’s widely believed today that the
                church was attempting to replace the Celtic festival of the dead with a related, church-sanctioned
                holiday.<br><br>The All Saints’ Day celebration was also called All-hallows or All-hallowmas (from
                Middle English Alholowmesse meaning All Saints’ Day) and the night before it, the traditional night of
                Samhain in the Celtic religion, began to be called All-Hallows Eve and, eventually, Halloween. Over many
                centuries, the three holidays—All Saints’ Day, All Souls' Day and Samhain—essentially merged into one:
                Halloween. (The Catholic Church still recognizes All Saints’ Day and All Souls' Day today, and some
                Wiccans and Celtic Reconstructionists commemorate Samhain.)

            <div class="subTime">Trick-or-Treating Emerges</div>
            <div class="des">In England and Ireland during All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day celebrations, poor people
                would visit the houses of wealthier families and receive pastries called soul cakes in exchange for a
                promise to pray for the souls of the homeowners’ dead relatives. Known as "souling," the practice was
                later taken up by children, who would go from door to door asking for gifts such as food, money and
                ale—an early form of trick-or-treating. </div>

            <div class="subTime">Jack-o-Lanterns Take Shape</div>
            <div class="des">The practice of carving faces into vegetables became associated with Halloween in Ireland
                and Scotland around the 1800s. Jack-o-lanterns originated from an Irish myth about a man nicknamed
                “Stingy Jack,” who tricked the Devil and was forced to roam the earth with only a burning coal in a
                turnip to light his way. People began to make their own versions of Jack’s lanterns by carving scary
                faces into turnips or potatoes and placing them into windows or near doors to frighten away Stingy Jack
                and other wandering evil spirits.</div>

            <div class="subTime">Halloween Comes to America</div>
            <div class="des">With the exception of Catholic-dominated Maryland and some other southern colonies,
                Halloween celebrations were extremely limited in early America, which was largely Protestant. It wasn't
                until the mid-19th century that new immigrants—especially the millions of Irish fleeing the Irish Potato
                Famine—helped popularize the celebration nationally.<br><br>These immigrants celebrated as they did back
                in their homelands—especially by pulling pranks. In the late 1800s, common Halloween tricks included
                placing farmers’ wagons and livestock on barn roofs, uprooting vegetables in backyard gardens and
                tipping over outhouses. By the early 20th century, vandalism, physical assaults and sporadic acts of
                violence were not uncommon on Halloween. </div>

            <div class="time">1930s</div>
            <div class="subTime">Haunted Houses Become Popular</div>
            <div class="des">Haunted or spooky public attractions already had some precedent in Europe. Starting in the
                1800s, Marie Tussaud’s wax museum in London featured a “Chamber of Horrors” with decapitated figures
                from the French Revolution. In 1915, a British amusement ride manufacturer created an early haunted
                house, complete with dim lights, shaking floors and demonic screams.<br><br>In the U.S., the Great
                Depression kickstarted the trend. By then, violence around Halloween—no doubt exacerbated by the dire
                economic conditions—had reached new highs. Parents, concerned about their children running amok on All
                Hallows' Eve, organized “haunted houses” or “trails” to keep them off the streets. </div>

            <div class="time">1950s</div>
            <div class="subTime">Halloween Costumes Go Mainstream </div>
            <div class="des">Costumes and disguises have figured into Halloween celebrations since the holiday's
                earliest days. But it wasn't until the mid-20th century that costumes started to look like what we know
                them as today. <br><br>Around the same time neighborhoods began organizing activities such as haunted
                houses to keep kids safe and occupied, costumes became more important (and less abstract and scary).
                They began to take the form of things children would have seen and enjoyed, like characters from popular
                radio shows, comics and movies. In the 1950s, mass-produced box costumes became more affordable, so more
                kids began to use them to dress up as princesses, mummies, clowns or more specific characters like
                Batman and Frankenstein’s monster. </div>

        <div class="text">
            <div class="time">1980s</div>
            <div class="subTime">Poisoned Candy Paranoia</div>
            <div class="des">While in general the fears about poisoned Halloween candy have been overblown, crimes
                involving poison have occurred. The most infamous case took place on October 31, 1974. That’s when a
                Texas man named Ronald O’Bryan gave cyanide-laced pixie sticks to five children, including his son. The
                other children never ate the candy, but his eight-year-old son, Timothy, did—and died soon after.
                <br><br> The paranoia reached new heights in the early 1980s after a rash of Tylenol poisonings in which
                cyanide-laced acetaminophen was placed on store shelves and sold. After the Tylenol murders, which are
                still unsolved, warnings about adulterated Halloween candy increased.
